<ul>
	<li>Dancing shoes have leather soles in order to provide the correct amount of friction between your shoes and the floor. Rubber soles on street shoes are too sticky for dancing and can mark dance floors.</li>
	<li>Your dancing shoe size would be around 1 full size smaller than your street shoes.</li>
	<li>Dancing shoes have to fit snuggly on your feet. While street shoes or dress shoes might be comfortable to walk in, they are unfit to dance in. <br/>
	<li>If you have never worn dance shoes before, trying on a snugg pair of dance shoes may feel quite uncomfortable at first because the leather materials<br/>
	are still quite stiff in the beginning. Once worn, or broken into, the leather would warp and wrap around your feet like a second layer of skin providing maximum stability and comfort.<br/>
	<span style='font-style:italic;'>Nothing can beat the comfort of a well worn dance shoe.</span>
	<li>You should be able to feel the floor with the tip of your toes when you point your shoes</li> 

</ul>
