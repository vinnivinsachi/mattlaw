	<p><strong>Q: How will your pants affect my dancing?</strong></p>
<p>
A: Our pants help create perfect dance lines for you. The material that we use is thicker than normal business suit pants, which allows the pants to drape elegantly towards the floor. Our pants also stretch slightly allowing you greater and effortless movement.</p>
 <br />

<p><strong>Q: The size that I want says &quot;backordered&quot;. Now what?</strong></p>
<p>A: We are constantly bringing in new pairs of dance pants for every size and we will update our inventory immediately once we get more in stock. Please <a href="index/contactus">contact us</a> for a more accurate timetable when your size will be back in stock.</p>
 <br />

<p><strong>Q: How do I figure out what size pants to order?</strong></p>
<p>A: Find a tape measure and wrap it snuggly around your waist (right above your hips!). Suck your stomach in slightly. Now measure. This is the waist size that you want to order.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: Can you dance both Latin and Standard in these pants?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. You can also use them for both Smooth and Rhythm as well.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: Can you make me a custom-tailored pair of dance pants?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. It may take as long as 5-6 weeks for them to be delivered to you, however. If you are still interested, please <a href="index/contactus">contact us</a> for more information and pricing.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: How do I wash my pants?</strong></p>
<p>A: Wash them cold and simply hang them up to dry to prevent wrinkles from forming. We would advise against putting them into a dryer. If you must iron them, iron them on a low heat setting.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: What are your shipping options?</strong></p>
<p>A: We ship all our products using USPS priority mail. Shipping should take 2-3 business days to reach most places in the United States.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: Will I need to alter these pants when I receive them?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, the only alteration needed will be the inseam as all our pants are shipped with a 38&quot; inseam. Simply take these pants into an alterations store and have them adjusted. Be sure to wear your dance shoes so that the store knows how much adjust the pants by.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: Is it possible to remove the belt loops, the foot straps, and your logo tag?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, it is easy to remove any or all three of these features. Simply remove the stitching and you&acute;re good to go.</p>
<br />
 
<p><strong>Q: How can I return/exchange my pants?</strong></p>
<p>A: We are more than happy to provide whichever service you prefer. Please visit <here> to read on our returns/exchange policy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you ship internationally?</strong></p>
