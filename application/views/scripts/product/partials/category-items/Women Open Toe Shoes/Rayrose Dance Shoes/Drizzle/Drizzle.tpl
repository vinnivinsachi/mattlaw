		<p>This popular five strap style gives fantastic flexibility.<br/><br/>

The foot is held by a central 'knot' allowing the straps to adjust during movement, keeping the foot secure.<br/><br/>

The unique stripping itself is constructed using a 'Fourfold' system, which combines strength with softness without requiring an additional lining.
